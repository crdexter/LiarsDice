# LairsDice

## Overview
This project is a simple text based game modeled after the game of dice played in the Pirates of the Caribbean. A game for 2 or more players using dice players use deceit and intuition to out smart their opponents to come out on top. Players will guess a number of dice higher than the previous player the side of the dice does not matter, but it must be a higher number of dice than the previous guess. Players can also call the previous
players guess a lie and check to win the game. This simple game is made using C++ and was used to learn fudamental skills writing in the language. 

 
## Skils I hope to Highlight
With this project I hope to highlight my knowledge of C++ fundamentals and application development. While this game does not require any advance knowledge it does use many basic skills and I hope to show my understanding and creativity with these.
